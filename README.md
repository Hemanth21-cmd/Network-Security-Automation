# ReconPro: Automated Vulnerability Scanner

## 🛠️ Project Overview
Developed a specialized Bash script to automate the initial reconnaissance phase of a security audit. This tool streamlines the process of service identification and vulnerability assessment for Windows-based systems.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Automated Enumeration:** Single-command execution for OS detection and service versioning using Nmap.
- **Vulnerability Scripting:** Integrated NSE (Nmap Scripting Engine) to check for critical exploits like MS17-010 (EternalBlue).
- **Structured Reporting:** Automatically exports scan results to a timestamped `.txt` report for audit documentation.
